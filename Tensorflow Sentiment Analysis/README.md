Included Files:
SimpleRNN.py
LSTM.py
glove.py

Instructions:
- Run SimpleRNN.py in order to run Part 1 of the assignment (learned word embeddings on SimpleRNN-based model)
- Run LSTM.py in order to run Part 2 of the assignment (learned word embeddings on LSTM-based model)
- Run glove.py in order to run Part 3 of the assignment (pretrained word embeddings on GRU-based model)

Notes:
Please give the programs patience! glove.py does take a while to run but it does work! Please ensure that the glove.6B folder is in the same directory as glove.py.
